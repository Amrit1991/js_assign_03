What is closure?
Closure is a function. It has a reference to a private variable. It is just same as the other functions in java script.It is enclosed under the parent function. it automatically contains the scope of its parents.
On the other hand,it is also known as a memory. It remembers the function,that is garbaged. So, in technical words closure is a function that has an access to the parent scope,which has garbaged. It has an approach to the global as well as local variables.
